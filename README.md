# Data driven decision making

This repository contains the Data-driven Decision Making course project of the Information Technology Program (ITP) from the Aalto University Business School. 
In this project, the objective was to create an operational database going through all steps of system development lifecycle starting with requirement analysis and including conceptual modeling  (ER models), logical modeling, implementation in an DBSM, and creating elements of a front-end interface.
 
Our group created an analytical datamart by utilizing star schema modeling. We also engaged in ETL activites that brought data from operational sources into the implemented datamart. Finally, we also created data visualizations based on the data from the datamart using Tableau.
