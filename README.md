## 📊 Rate It! – Aalto University DDDM Course Project
Welcome to the **Data-driven Decision Making (DDDM)** course project for the **Information Technology Program (ITP)** at Aalto University Business School.

This repository presents **Rate It!**, a conceptual platform designed to allow students to **rate professors and campus spaces** across Finnish universities. This project reflects the full cycle of **operational database development** and **analytical processing** — from initial requirements to interactive visualizations.

## 🚀 Project Overview
The goal of this project was to **design and implement a complete data system** that supports both operational needs and analytical insights. Our team followed the **System Development Lifecycle (SDLC)** to build a working prototype, including:

## 📋 Requirement Analysis

* 🧩 Conceptual Modeling (ER Diagrams)

* 🛠️ Logical Modeling (Relational Schema)

* 🗃️ Database Implementation (DBMS)

* 🧮 Analytical Modeling (Star Schema)

* 🔄 ETL Pipelines

* 📊 Visualizations in Tableau

## 🧠 Project Concept: Rate It!
**Rate It!** is a data platform concept where students can:

* Rate professors based on teaching quality, engagement, and clarity

* Review study spaces, cafeterias, and facilities across Finnish universities

* Explore average ratings and trends across faculties and campuses

## 🏗️ Implementation Highlights
### ✅ Operational Database
Designed using **Entity-Relationship (ER) modeling**.

Translated into a **normalized relational schema**.

Implemented using **Microsoft SQL Server**.

### 📦 Data Mart (Analytics Layer)
**Star schema** designed for analytics and performance.

**ETL processes** loaded data from the operational DB into the data mart.

###  📊 Tableau Dashboards
Created user-friendly dashboards to explore:

Top-rated professors and year of hire.

Average ratings of professors

Rate It! usage through the week.

## 🖥️ Technologies Used
**Microsoft SQL Server** – DBMS for both operational and analytical databases.

**SQL** – Schema creation, data insertion, transformations.

**Tableau** – Interactive data visualizations.

**Draw.io** – ER and Star schema modeling.

**Python** –  for ETL scripting.
